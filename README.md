# Endless Gauntlet

A plugin for the free and open-source 2D space trading and combat game [Endless Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/).
It contains a python script to generate an arcade-style gauntlet wherein you take a mission, jump through a wormhole, and face a series of randomly generated fleets.

Intended for end-game players who are comfortable running a python script, and toggling some options related to how the gauntlet gets built.

* How To Use
  * Windows users need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) .
  * OSX and Linux users should have it installed already.
  * Open params.txt and add the path to your Endless Sky/data directory, and optionally your plugin directory. This is also where you tweak the difficulty of the gauntlet to your liking.
  * Run the generate.py script, and the endless-gauntlet/data folder will be populated with the necessary files.

## Install
Unzip to your plugins folder found here:

* Linux: ~/.local/share/endless-sky/
* Windows: %AppData%\endless-sky\
* Mac OS X: ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/
